# MySQL-User-Behaviour-Analysis

The aim of this project is to analyse user behaviour through E-Commerce Date by using MySQL. 

The analysis will consist of 
1. data cleaning
2. analysis based on consumer purchase behaviour
3. time & date analysis
4. analysis on consumer retention rate
5. product analysis


Result and suggestion:
1. there are no specific date where sudden peak of customer volume on the website, but customer are more likely to use the website during 19:00 - 21:00
2. payment rate is 16%-22%, website can offer some promotion to increase spending rate
3. customer retention rate is decreasing in 2nd, 3rd and 7th day respectively. Need to found out reason why, such as UI problem, product range insufficient etc
4. despite product has high view, the conversion rate to purchase is low. One possible explanation is price issue that pushed customer away
